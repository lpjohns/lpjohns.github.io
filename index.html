    <h2 id="about" class="awesome">About me</h2>

    <h3 class="awesome">My midwest childhood</h3>

    <p>
      I grew up on the East side of wonderful Madison, Wisconsin with my inspiring and creative parents and sister.
    </p>

    <h3 class="awesome">The travel bug</h3>

    <p>
      In 2001 I travelled to Israel and then studied in Belgium. Through these two trips I caught the travel bug and have lived in the US, UK and Middle East since then.
    </p>

    <h3 class="awesome">Career then, now and in the future</h3>

    <p>
      My professional career started in HR consulting and continued in strategy consulting. On the side I also started a jewellery business, and am always bursting with ideas for new ventures. Watch this space.
    </p>

    <h3 class="awesome">My other loves</h3>

    <p>
      When I'm not working, I love making jewellery, discovering new music, exploring cities with my awesome partner-in-crime and husband, running, making gluten-free foods and trying my hand at various different crafts.
